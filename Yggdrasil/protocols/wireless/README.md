# Protocols for Wireless Ad Hoc networks

We implement a variety of wireless ad hoc protocols using Yggdrasil abstractions.

We provide a brief description:

## Aggregation Protocols

### Flow Updating

For more details please refer to the original [paper](https://haslab.uminho.pt/cbm/files/flow_updating.pdf).

### Generic Aggregation Protocol (GAP)

For more details please refer to the original [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-GENERIC-PROTOCOL-FOR-NETWORK-STATE-AGGREGATION-Dam-Stadler/5084adcc2bd604496ceda91ce15149177788a3b3).

### LiMoSense

For more details please refer to the original [paper](http://webee.technion.ac.il/people/ittay/publications/dynamicAverageAggregationAlgoSensor11.pdf).

### Multi Root Aggregation (MiRAge)

For more details please refer to the original [paper](http://asc.di.fct.unl.pt/~jleitao/pdf/MiRAge.pdf).

## Communication Protocols

### Broadcast - Push Gossip

### Point-to-Point - Reliable Delivery

### Routing - B.A.T.M.A.N.

For more details please refer to the original [specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wunderlich-openmesh-manet-routing-00).

## Discovery Protocols

### Simple Discovery

### Discovery with Fault Detection

## Alternative Dispatchers

### Dispatcher with Metric Logs

## Other Utility Protocols

### Topology Manager
